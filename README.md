# Material Résumé

---

## Introduction
Professional Résumés and Curriculum Vitae formalities follow conventions from as [early as the 1500's](http://mashable.com/2011/09/04/history-of-the-resume/ ""History of the Resume). Material Resume is a fresh take on how this old formality can be improved to meet the current recipient's expectations using [Google's Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) visual language. 

Built using modern web development workflow tools, such as:

* Bower for package management, 
* Gulp and plugins for web development task management, 
* Jade as HTML template language 
* Materialize SASS as CSS scaffolding
* And JSON for content layer

You also be able to take the first impressions to new heights.
